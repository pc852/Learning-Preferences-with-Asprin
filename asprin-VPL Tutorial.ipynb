    "\n",
    "*asprin-vL* builds on the existing answer set programming (ASP) framework *asprin* and is designed to learn preferences using  labeled data. This tutorial assumes foundational knowledge in ASP syntax and ASP solver/grounder *clingo*. Prior experience with *asprin* would be helpful towards understanding this framework. Tutorial on preference optimization with *asprin* can be found in the *Potassco* user guide, under the chapter 'optimization and preference handling': https://github.com/potassco/guide/releases\n",

    "Input:\n",
    "1. pairs of models alongisde a label indicating the preferred model between the pair. The models are made up of binary atoms (either a fact or not).\n",
    "2. the domain of the binary atoms and the total number of models for training.\n",
    "3. the types of preference relation allowed and the corresponding range of preference instances as part of a preference statement, in the form of choice rules. \n",

    "Output:\n",
    "1. preference statement(s) in the syntax of *asprin* which best fits the input data \n",
